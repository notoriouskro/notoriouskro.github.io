Projects:

Footprint

Footprint was designed to make national parks more approachable. It allows users to explore a variety of parks across the united states. It gives users some general information, current weather, hiking trails and more. 

When a user creates an account, they can track trips they plan on taking. The travel itinerary gives the user a snapsot of the weather forecast during their travel.

The webapp will continue to be developed to allow users to track the trails they plan on hiking during their trip.
    
Hockey Trivia

The aim for this game was to utilize timers in addition to user input to answer a series of questions. The user gets immediate feedback after each question. They also will get a full scoreboard at the end that shows the number correct, incorrect, and unanswered.

Fortune Teller Game

This game is designed to give a user 9 guesses to correctly predict the value selected by the computer. The game tracks all the incorrect guess. If the user correctly guesses the right letter then they win and the game restarts. If they guess incorrectly 9 times the user gets a loss and the game restarts.

The Simpsons Giphy

During the study of APIs we were tasked with created a Gif search engine. The webapp dynamically creates new buttons based upon user input. The preloaded or newly created buttons search for a series Gifs. These require a click to play. They also feature a title and rating.

Music Game

The music game creates values for a total score and each individual item. The user must figure out the value of each item and get to the total score without going over. If the user gets to the correct total or goes over they will get a win or loss and the game starts over. All values are dynamically reconfigured.
